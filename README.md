**This is a minimalist-style theme.**


## about

Just started using Obsidian, in the process of exploring. I hope to make the window display in a minimalist and pure way such as using Notes on a Mac.


## features

![Pure](https://github.com/lychileng/Obsidian-Theme-Pure/blob/main/screenshots/Pure%20Theme.gif?raw=true)  

Compatible with both macOS and Windows:
+ The Ribbon area will automatically hide and display when the mouse moves to the left edge of the window.
+ The Actions button in the Ribbon is displayed aligned to the bottom.
+ The effect is even better when the "**Window frame style**" is set to "**Hidden (default)**".
+ Change the Task's Checkbox to a circular shape for a more comfortable visual experience.
+ Change the style of bullet list. Modify the first four levels to solid/hollow circles and squares.

## plans

This is an initial version, no additional design has been applied to the font, color, icons, and other elements yet. If there's time...ðŸ˜Š


## btw

If you don't feel like downloading this theme, you can also download the CSS snippet and apply it directly in the appearance settings.
