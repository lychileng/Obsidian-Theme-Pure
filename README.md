### about
Strictly speaking, this is not a "conventional" theme. It doesn't have visual creative optimizations, complex color designs, nor is it intended for custom plugin functions.  

Choosing Obsidian as a knowledge management tool is to value the offline security of data, and the high compatibility and easy migration of Markdown text.  

The main principle of this theme is still to adhere to the "original flavor" while making some minor adjustments to operations and usability. It's more for my own preference, and I share it here for everyone to use at will.
 
### features
![Pure](https://github.com/lychileng/Obsidian-Theme-Pure/blob/1b9a960164b400569fb81888a34997e3f58527ef/screenshots/Pure%20Theme.gif?raw=true)  
+ **Hidden Ribbon**: The Ribbon will automatically show or hide when the mouse enters or leaves the left side of the window.
+ **Round Task List**: No other reason, I just prefer round over square, and lean towards Apple's style.
+ **Tiered Bullet List**: Use solid/hollow circles and squares to mark the first four levels of bullet lists, just like Word does.

### screenshots
+ macOS / Windows, everything is normal.

    > Well, I don't have any Linux or Android device, and am too lazy to build virtual machines, but theoretically, everything should be normal. ðŸ˜‚  


### Log
+ Pleased that Obsidian has been updated to version 1.6.x, so I have to update my basic theme to adapt to it. ðŸ˜‚
+ BTW, help the officials fix a bug in the collapse indicator's position. ðŸ¥±
